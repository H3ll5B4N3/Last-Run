Sprites are a series of images (frames) combined into one single image file for efficient animation casting. 

Here are some tips on how to use it:
1. Calculate the width of the sprite (the entire img) and divide it up so you know which image is in which coordinate. (Each frame is a square) You might even store these coordinates into an array. 

2. You need to make a function(s) that executes the animation when the player presses the arrow key. The frame will start at frame 1, then traverse to the last frame.

3. This does not mean change frames every 0.00001 seconds. Note: The game runs in fps (frames per second). You must create an algorithm that calculates when to change frame during that 1 second. Note: The number of frames very if you have 60fps, 40fps...etc.

I may or may not provide code or even pseudo-code in the future depending on how much work I still need to do.
